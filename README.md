#Gimli - WebGL VR Experiments for Five.
Gimli is the place where the survivors of Ragnorak are foretold to dwell. It is the most beautiful place on earth.

Gimli is the place where the survivors of the technological Ragnorak occur - after VR becomes mainstream and we're so connected to technology that we're no longer connected to people. Gimli is a virtual space to connect with people.
